            <h3>How I built my startup as solo product designer</h3>
            <p>Ivorydigitalhub was born during Covid-19, February 2020. Back in the time, I was suffering in finding a job. So I decided to start my own business at the same time I join<a href="wewave.html"><b>WeWave</b></a> as a product designer.<br><br>
                As graphic design background, I often work with customers who are looking to increase their productivity. One of the ways that I help them achieve this is by designing digital planners and digital notebooks. Digital planners offer several advantages over traditional paper planners. First, they can be easily customized to individual needs and preferences. This means that users are more likely to actually use them, which leads to better time management and increased productivity. Second, digital planners are typically much more compact than paper planners, which makes them more convenient to carry around. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, digital planners are more environmentally friendly. By eliminating the need for paper and ink, they help to reduce carbon emissions. In a world that is increasingly focused on sustainability, this is an important consideration.</p>
            <br>
                <h3>üí°What's digital planner?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A digital planner is an electronic version of a traditional planner. It is a digital notebook that allows users to manage and organize their schedules, tasks, and appointments in a digital format. Digital planners can be accessed on various devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and can be synced across devices for easy access and updates.</p>

              <h3>What I learned from this</h3>
              <p>Prior to embarking on the product design process, I asked myself two questions: 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Where do I start?</b>
                <br>
                <b>How can I successfully sell my own designs and generate income?</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                To answer these questions, I conducted market research through various online platforms, such as Etsy, Google shop, and Shopify, seeking products that aligned with my objectives. This involved creating the product from scratch and considering how I could sell the idea and make profits through online sales. My goal was to achieve success within a span of 6 months.</p>
                <br>
              </div>
            <div class="column2 right2">
              <h3>The approach</h3>
              <p>As a small business owner, I was faced with an entirely new experience, having to formulate a solid business plan and execute my ideas. Despite possessing a solid background in graphic design, I found the task of designing an interactive planner to be completely novel. To tackle this challenge, I turned to Youtube for guidance and began designing planners by following tutorials. In approaching all aspects of the business with a proactive and determined mindset, I was able to successfully create a product that met my expectations.</p>

              <p>My goal is to create a product that helps to reduce paper waste and ultimately protects trees. The overuse of paper products is a major environmental concern, as it leads to deforestation and habitat destruction. With the rise of technology, we now have the ability to create tools that are just as effective. If not more so, than traditional paper planners. By using digital planners, we can eliminate the need for paper and reduce the negative on the environment and contribute to a more sustainable future.

        To optimize the layout design of the all-in-one feature planner for my shop, I created a product structure flow. This approach allowed me to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the product's structure and helped me to prioritize the layout design as a key component of the planner's overall user experience.

            <p>
              During the research process, it was found that many users desired additional features for their planners. In response, I designed digital stickers that could be easily duplicated and written on by users. This add-on provides users with a customizable and personalized touch to their planner, allowing them to enhance their planning experience in a unique way.

Its design ensures that the text is easy to read and provides a visually appealing aesthetic that enhances the overall user experience.

            <p>
              Through the process of building a startup, I've come to learn invaluable lessons. To be honest, I never imagined myself as a business owner, and the challenges I faced were immense. 
              I dedicated long hours to work, sacrificing leisure activities like watching TV or playing games. Yet, the rewards were worth it. Building everything by myself was far from easy, but the experience taught me not only about product design but also the intricacies of running a successful business.

             <p>
              IvoryDigitalHub continues to experience growth and expansion, with new products being developed and introduced every month. Looking ahead, the next milestone is to attain 100,000 followers on my social media accounts. This represents an exciting step forward in our ongoing efforts to connect with and engage a wider audience. I remain committed to providing innovative products and delivering value to our customers, and this is just one of the many ways we're striving to achieve that goal.
